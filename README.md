## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used this challenge to recap some of the code highlights that I learned from different sites. It has taught me and given me courage to go further in this field of development using CSS and HTML. I didn't use React coz this was not so much of React.

The use of <div> components has helped me alot to style easily.
```html
<div class='container'>
  <img src='./images/my-image' alt='my-image' class='container__image' />
</div>
```


### Continued development

- I would like to continue building my skills in CSS flexbox and all properties of CSS.
- i would also like to improve my skills in ReactJS, NextJS.

### Useful resources

- [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) - This helped me to find the colors to use in the project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use google fonts and how to import them and use them in my projects. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
